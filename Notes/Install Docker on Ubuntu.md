# Installing Docker on Ubuntu

Installing Docker on Ubuntu from the command line is a multi-step process

First, install some packages that will allow us to use a repository over https

```bash
  sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
  sudo apt-get install ca-certificates
  sudo apt-get install curl
  sudo apt-get install gnupg-agent
  sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
```

In order to fully install Docker, you'll need to add Dockers official GPG key to the system

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```  

Now we can add the docker repository

```bash
  sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu  $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```  

Finally! We can install Docker

```bash
  sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

If you want to go ahead and install SQL Server, first you need to download its image

```bash
sudo docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
```

Now you can run what we just downloaded. A few notes:

* The -e is extra pieces info. Make sure to use a good password for the SA account
* The -p is the port number we need to map. The first number listens on the local machine, then passes traffic into the container via the second port number. As SQL Server uses port 1433 we'll use that for both values.
* The --name is what you want to name your server, use a name of your selection here
* Finally -d is the image we should run, which should match the image name we downloaded in the previous step.

```bash
sudo docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=passW0rd!' -p 1433:1433 --name arcanesql -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
```

## Extra - checking to see if docker exists

You might want to include some code to see if Docker already exists on your system. If so you can use this simple template

```bash
if [ -x "$(command -v docker)" ]; then
  echo "Docker is already installed"
else
  echo "Install Docker"
fi
```
