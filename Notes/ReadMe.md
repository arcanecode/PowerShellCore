# Notes

## Overview

This folder contains notes and instructions for various subjects used during the course. In some cases they act as manual instructions for when you want to step by step repeat what you see in the course video.

All notes, including this ReadMe, are in MarkDown format. As such they are best read either on the authors github site, or using a markdown preview tool in VSCode. Two extensions, "Markdown Preview Enhanced" and "Markdown All in One" were tested and both provided good results, use what works better for you.
