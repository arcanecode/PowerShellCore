# Install SQL Server as a Docker Container

## Download SQL Server

First, download the Docker container for SQL Server

```bash
sudo docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
```

## Run SQL Server

Now launch the container with SQL Server.

```bash
sudo docker run -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=<YourStrong!Passw0rd>' -p 1433:1433 --name sql1 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
```

## Connecting from Azure Data Studio

To connect to SQL Server inside Azure Data Studio in Ubuntu, use localhost,1433 as the server name, sa as user, and enter your password.

## Other tips and tricks

To view your containers:

```bash
sudo docker ps -a
```

To open a bash session inside the docker container

```bash
sudo docker exec -it arcanesql "bash"
```

From there you can test SQL by entering a sqlcmd session

```bash
/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P '<YourNewStrong!Passw0rd>'
```

You can then see what is in master:

```sql
SELECT * FROM master.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
GO
```
