# All commands in PowerShell are in the form of a verb-noun syntax
Get-ChildItem

# A command in PowerShell is known as a cmdlet

# Move to a folder
Set-Location Downloads

# Relative Postions work too
Set-Location ..

# Clear the display
Clear-Host


# Here it produces a list of items in the current location. 
# The current location is displayed in the prompt, here it is a folder
# in the file system. 

# You can find a list of the currently loaded commands by using:
Get-Command

# Note the 'currently loaded'. You can extend the commands available to 
# you through the addition of modules. We will talk briefly about modules
# in a later module. 

# If you want to learn more about a command, you can always get help
# on it. 
Get-Help Get-Command 

# Right after installing PowerShell, and periodically thereafer, you
# should update your help library
# Unfortunately there is currently a bug in PowerShell Core on Ubuntu
# that prevents it from working.

# Reading Markdown
# Note, you must be using PowerShell Core 6.1 or greater!

# First set a variable to your root path where you extracted the code
# An example for Linux
$rootPath = '/home/arcanecode/Documents/code/PowerShellCore/PowerShellCore/Notes/'

# If you are on Windows (yes, I know the course is for Linux / macOS but
# PowerShell Core works on Windows too) here's an example
$rootPath = 'C:\Users\arcan\OneDrive\Pluralsight\PowerShell Core\Notes\'

# Clear the output window
Clear-Host

# Now just pick the MD file you want and run that one line of code to see the output

# Shows how to configure Ubuntu with some basic utilities

# How to install PowerShell Core, VSCode, and Azure Data Studio on macOS

ConvertFrom-Markdown -Path "$($rootPath)Install SQL Server in Docker on Ubuntu.md" -AsVT100EncodedString | Show-Markdown

# Even though Windows is not covered in this course, these demos will still work
# if you install PowerShell Core on a Windows Machine. By default though, VSCode
# will want to use PowerShell 5.1 as the default terminal. The instructions here
# show how to change that to PowerShell Core.
