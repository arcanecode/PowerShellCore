  Notes on this script

  As you get comfortable writing reusable functions, you will want to place
  them in one or more scripts you can call over and over again. In this
  file, we'll show how to execute the script m10-reuse-1-functions. This
  will then place then functions contained in that script into memory.

  Then, we'll call the function inside this script to demonstrate the 
  ability to reuse a set of functions across multiple scripts.

# Set the location
# Linux
Set-Location '/home/arcanecode/code/PowerShellCore/PowerShellCore'

# macOS 
Set-Location '/Users/arcanecode/Documents/code/pscore/PowerShellCore'

# Try to execute the function before it is loaded 
Add-SomeNumbers 1 2

# ...or try and get help on it
Get-Help Add-SomeNumbers

# And you'll get errors. So now run the script to load its functions into memory

. ./Demo/m10-reuse-1-functions.ps1

Get-Help Add-SomeNumbers

Add-SomeNumbers 1 2
